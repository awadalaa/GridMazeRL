# GridWorld Q-Learning Demo Webapp

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the basics of reinforcement learning using Q-learning in a gridworld environment. An agent learns to navigate a 5×5 grid from a starting point at (0, 0) to a goal at (4, 4) by updating its Q-values based on the rewards it receives for each move.

## Features

- **Simple Environment:** A 5×5 grid with a clear start (top-left) and goal (bottom-right).
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implementation of a basic Q-learning algorithm with an ε-greedy exploration strategy.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** A minimal web page to visualize the grid, the agent's position, and control the learning process with step and reset buttons.
- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for beginners who want to understand the core concepts of reinforcement learning and web development integration.
